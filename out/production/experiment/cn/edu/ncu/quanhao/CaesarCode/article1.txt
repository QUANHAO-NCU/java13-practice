The arrival of Java 13
Sharat Chander 
DIRECTOR, JAVA SE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 

With the release of Java 9 in 2017, the Java release schedule shifted, 
from a major release every 3+ years to a feature release every six-months.  
One of the main reasons for this change was to offer developers more predictable 
access to continued enhancements. Feature releases now reliably occur in March 
and September of every year, which means developer no longer have to manage 
hundreds of changes every few years all at once.  By gaining access to new 
enhancements at a more granular and faster measure, developers can much 
more easily manage the pace of innovation as proven by Java 10 offering 12 
new enhancements, Java 11 offering 17 new enhancements, and Java 12 
offering 8 new enhancements.
